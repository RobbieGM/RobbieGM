### Hi there, I'm Robbie!

I'm a student at the University of Michigan pursuing a computer science major and intending to graduate in 2025. I have been programming since 2011. When I'm not busy with schoolwork, I compose music, play online chess, or work on personal programming projects in my spare time. My favorite technologies currently are Node, React, Next.js, and Git, but I'm willing to learn anything. I'm always trying to learn the latest and greatest technologies and techniques and integrate them into my work. I have most of my programming experience in web development, but I'm looking to branch out a little right now and put my skills in C++ or Java to use.

### Hi there, I'm Robbie!

I'm a student at the University of Michigan pursuing a computer science major and intending to graduate in 2025. I have been programming since 2011. When I'm not busy with schoolwork, I compose music, play online chess, or work on personal programming projects in my spare time. My favorite technologies currently are Node, React, Next.js, and Git, but I'm willing to learn anything. I'm always trying to learn the latest and greatest technologies and techniques and integrate them into my work.

Right now, in particular, I'm trying to figure out what the web development world needs with regard to performance at runtime and load time. It's a shame that so much of the web is bloated, hurting load time, but perhaps an even harder problem is getting smooth runtime performance when every DOM update triggers a cascade of inefficient browser operations and jank.

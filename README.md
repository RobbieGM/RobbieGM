### Hi there, I'm Robbie!

I'm a student at the University of Michigan pursuing a computer science major and intending to graduate in 2025. I have been programming since 2011. When I'm not busy with schoolwork, I work on personal programming projects, compose music, or play chess in my spare time. Above all, I value delivering maintainable software that is a joy to use.
